-- Requirements for lb-passport-renewal-temporary-residence, extracted 2026-08-26.
--
-- GENERATED FILE. Do not hand-edit.
--   source: data/requirements/lb-passport-renewal-temporary-residence.json
--   generator: scripts/visa-registry/generate-requirements.mjs
--   method: manual
--
-- Every row below quotes the official page it was read from, and binds to
-- that source's ACTIVE version via subquery rather than a pasted uuid — so
-- if the page moved since extraction, the requirement attaches to what is
-- actually live and the sync's change queue catches the drift.
--
-- Rows are inserted as DRAFT. Promotion to 'active' is a separate step,
-- because that is the step where a person takes responsibility for the claim.
--
-- DELIBERATELY NOT EXTRACTED:
--   * Residence Permits for Iraqi Nationals in Lebanon (posts/428). The served page carries five lines that refer to "the residency mentioned in item (2) above" and "residency applications mentioned in item (1) above" — and items (1) and (2) are NOT on the page in any form, in the normalised text or in the raw HTML. Publishing a cross-reference to a list the reader cannot see would be worse than publishing nothing.
--   * The Arabic-language tree. This authority publishes English and Arabic separately; only the English tree is read, and no claim is made that the two say the same thing.
--   * Routes still enumerated on the index and not yet extracted: sponsorship transfer applications, the complaint procedure for an escaping foreign worker, temporary residence renewal via LibanPost, applying for a visa renewal via Liban Post, the kafala-transfer regularisation, entry of nationals from labour-supplying countries, work permits for foreign artists and musicians, entry of artists in nightclubs, and the Syrian and Palestinian arrangements. Named so the gap is a known quantity rather than an impression of completeness.
