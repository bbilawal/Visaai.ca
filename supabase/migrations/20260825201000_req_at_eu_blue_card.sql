-- Requirements for at-eu-blue-card, extracted 2026-08-25.
--
-- GENERATED FILE. Do not hand-edit.
--   source: data/requirements/at-eu-blue-card.json
--   generator: scripts/visa-registry/generate-requirements.mjs
--   method: manual
--
-- Every row below quotes the official page it was read from, and binds to
-- that source's ACTIVE version via subquery rather than a pasted uuid — so
-- if the page moved since extraction, the requirement attaches to what is
-- actually live and the sync's change queue catches the drift.
--
-- Rows are inserted as DRAFT. Promotion to 'active' is a separate step,
-- because that is the step where a person takes responsibility for the claim.
--
-- DELIBERATELY NOT EXTRACTED:
--   * Fees. The page names none.
--   * The family-status documents (marriage, divorce, partnership, adoption, death certificates) which the page lists as 'as applicable' rather than required, so recording them as requirements would overstate them.
