-- Requirements for dk-permanent-residence, extracted 2026-08-26.
--
-- GENERATED FILE. Do not hand-edit.
--   source: data/requirements/dk-permanent-residence.json
--   generator: scripts/visa-registry/generate-requirements.mjs
--   method: manual
--
-- Every row below quotes the official page it was read from, and binds to
-- that source's ACTIVE version via subquery rather than a pasted uuid — so
-- if the page moved since extraction, the requirement attaches to what is
-- actually live and the sync's change queue catches the drift.
--
-- Rows are inserted as DRAFT. Promotion to 'active' is a separate step,
-- because that is the step where a person takes responsibility for the claim.
--
-- DELIBERATELY NOT EXTRACTED:
--   * The full sentencing table — roughly twenty categories of sentence each with its own exclusion period, at lines 100 to 132. The general rules ARE extracted; the table is a schedule of criminal-law consequences that would need a lawyer's reading of any individual case, and publishing it as a checklist would invite exactly that misuse.
--   * The full list of qualifying and disqualifying social benefits, which the authority publishes on a separate linked page.
--   * The registration procedure and dates for the active citizen exam.
--   * The step-by-step application walkthrough and document checklists.
--   * The separate permanent-residence routes the catalogue enumerates alongside this one — for 18-to-19-year-olds, on strong attachment to Denmark, for retired employees of international organisations, and for Greenland and the Faroe Islands.
