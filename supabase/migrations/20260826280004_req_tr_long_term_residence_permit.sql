-- Requirements for tr-long-term-residence-permit, extracted 2026-08-26.
--
-- GENERATED FILE. Do not hand-edit.
--   source: data/requirements/tr-long-term-residence-permit.json
--   generator: scripts/visa-registry/generate-requirements.mjs
--   method: manual
--
-- Every row below quotes the official page it was read from, and binds to
-- that source's ACTIVE version via subquery rather than a pasted uuid — so
-- if the page moved since extraction, the requirement attaches to what is
-- actually live and the sync's change queue catches the drift.
--
-- Rows are inserted as DRAFT. Promotion to 'active' is a separate step,
-- because that is the step where a person takes responsibility for the claim.
--
-- DELIBERATELY NOT EXTRACTED:
--   * The application DOCUMENT lists. The index links them at `e-ikamet.goc.gov.tr/Ikamet/IstenenBelgeler`, which returns 13,615 bytes normalising to 379 characters — the list is rendered entirely by script. This is not a refusal (robots.txt is 404, conventionally unrestricted) and not a parse failure; there is no server-rendered text to read. So this registry publishes what the LAW requires — eligibility, duration, conditions, cancellation grounds and fees — and cannot publish the counter-by-counter paperwork.
--   * The VISA side of Turkish entry, which is a different authority — the Ministry of Foreign Affairs — and is already published under its own eight routes. This page is about permission to STAY, not permission to enter.
